# Git Flow

- Before running `git add .` (or staging any changes), first run:

  ```bash
  black .
  ```

  to auto-format your code (indentation, styling, etc.).

- Use `git diff` or `git diff --staged` to check the differences before generating a commit message.

- All `git commit` messages must follow the projectâ€™s established commit-message style; use `git log` to check previous commits for reference.
